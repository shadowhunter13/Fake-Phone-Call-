# Fake-Phone-Call-
I built a script that gives me a fake phone call to escape boring and awkward situations. I bought a virtual number from Twilio and saved it as one of my relatives. Whenever I feel stuck, I just tap a button called “ESCAPE” on my phone. It sends a request to my remote server. The server runs a small Python script which schedules an actual call.
